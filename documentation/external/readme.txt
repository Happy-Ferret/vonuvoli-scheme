This folder MUST be considered as DISJOINT and EXTERNAL from the rest of the repository.

The files within this folder have not been created (or changed) by me,
they were publicly accessible (as of 2017) on the internet,
they belong to their original writer,
they have specific licenses (most likely included within them),
and I did include them only for CACHING purposes.

Many of the files (including the R7RS specification) can't be found on the internet (as of 2017).
